It has been long assumed that it holds some resemblance to the phenemenon of turbulence. As shown in this TED-ED [video.](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-unexpected-math-behind-van-gogh-s-starry-night-natalya-st-clair#discussion-open)
There are even some stunning [academic journals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03381.pdf) on the topic.
