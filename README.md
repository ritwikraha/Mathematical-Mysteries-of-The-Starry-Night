Art is certainly about as subjective as it comes. Whereas, science is not. Whether or not one agrees this painting to be a a masterpiece, the fact remains that, the painting depicts spectacular patterns.
It has been long assumed that it holds some resemblance to the phenemenon of turbulence. As shown in this TED-ED [video.](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-unexpected-math-behind-van-gogh-s-starry-night-natalya-st-clair#discussion-open)
There are even some stunning [academic journals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03381.pdf) on the topic.

However is that all?
Or is there some deeper mathematical patterns lying underneath this beautiful artwork.
